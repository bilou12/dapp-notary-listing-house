# Dapp notary listing house

In this project, we will be minting our own tokens to represent titles of properties. Before minting a token, we will verify the owner owns the property. We will use zk-SNARKs to create a verification system which can prove you have title to the property without revealing that specific information on the property. The basics on zk-SNARKs has been covered in Privacy lesson in Course 5 of the Udacity Blockchain Engineer Nanodegree Program.

Once the token has been verified we will place it on a blockchain market place (OpenSea) for others to purchase. Let's get started!
